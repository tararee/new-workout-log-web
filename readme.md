when you clone this you will need to add a file called .env in the /server directory

the contents should contain your global constant:

JWT_SECRET=this_is_a_secret


then go to the server directory and run `npm install`
run the server using `node app.js` from the server directory

in the /client directory run `npm install` and `bower install`
run the http_server using `npm start` note: on mac change the "start" command in package.json so that the slashes are / instead of \\
# my-workout-log
# new-workout-log-web
